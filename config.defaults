# Vlad configuration file.
#
# Recipe for installing/configuring.
# 0. Unpack the tar.gz file into a source directory. (NOTE: you unpack vlad into one
#	directory, and Install it into (and run it out of) another. 
# 1. Copy config.defaults to config.cfg
# 2. Make desired changes to config.cfg. Mainly, you'll want to:
#    - set vladDir to the (web-accessible) directory where you want it installed. 
#	By default, this directory is used to serve up static content (e.g. the
#	query form), run the CGI (python script), write the output files.
#    - set vladUrl to the appropriate URL (just the path part) for accessing vlad
#	E.g., if you will serve vlad at http://my.server.org/apps/vlad, then
#	vladUrl would be /apps/vlad
#    - by default, the CGI runs out of vladDir. If you need to change that, set 
#	cgiDir and cgiUrl
#    - by default, output files are written to a directory inside of vladDir.
#	If you need to change that, set outputDir and outputUrl
#    - configure the ontologies and the annotation sets that vlad knows about
#	By default, Vlad comes preconfigured with a sample ontology and sample 
#	data set that you can use for testing. In a real installation, you'll want 
#	to configure these sections to point to the real ontologies and annotations
#	that you'll be using.
#    - set the DOT executable variable. Vlad generates graph drawings using the dot
#	program, which is part of the GraphViz package. You'll need to install GraphViz
#	and point Vlad to it.
# 3. Run the Install:
#	$ python Install config.cfg
# 4. To tweak the installation later, repeat steps 2 and 3.

[DOT/]

# Specify the default font for node labels at the top level, rather
# than in the /nodes subgraph. This allows us to override it on the
# command line. The reason: different output formats support different
# fonts. (E.g., for doing PNGs or GIFs, Arial is a good san serif font,
# while Helvetica looks awful. But if you want EPS output, Arial is not
# even recognized (and Courier is substituted!) while Helvetica is fine.
# To override, use the "-Nname=value" command line option, e.g.
#	% dot -Nfontname=Helvetica -Teps -o mygraph.eps mygraph.dot
